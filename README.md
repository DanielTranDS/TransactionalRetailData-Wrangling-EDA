Data Wrangling, graphical &amp; non-graphical EDA methods to find and fix data problems for transactional retail data from an online electronics store, using Python

In this project, I perform a very thorough and extensive data wrangling and cleansing in 3 datasets, in order to identify any data quality problems, any inconsistency among the attributes, and perform fixes. These 3 datasets contain transactional retail data from an online electronics store located in Melbourne, Australia. The store is exclusively online, and it has 3 warehouses around Melbourne from which goods are delivered to customers. In particular,

For Dirty_data dataset, the data quality problems mainly come in the form of inconsistency of values within the attributes, as well as the interaction among the attributes themselves. I will identify all of these problems and fix them, with the help of business rules.

For Outlier_data dataset, the data quality problems mainly come in the form of outliers. I will detect all of them and remove them.

For Missing_data dataset, the data quality problems mainly come in the form of missing data. I will identify them and impute them with appropriate methods, with the help of business rules.

The business rules associated with these datasets are laid out in the Jupyter notebook codes files:

Afterwards, I will combine the 3 cleansed datasets into 1 dataset, and perform Exploratory Data Analysis, with Univariate Analysis and Multivariate Analysis
